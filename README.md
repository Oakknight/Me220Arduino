This package contains an .ino file for the Arduino IDE as well as an .cpp file for development.

Instead of the normal Arduino IDE, I used VSCode with the PlatformIO extension. All my files and development process
can be found on the following github link.

All modes are working fine. Further debouncing could be implemented for mode 4, button counting.
